A Physics-Constrained and Data-Driven Approach for Thermal Field Inversion in Chiplet-based packaging
//Abstract
The chiplet-based packaging integrates multiple heterogeneous chiplets with distinct functionalities and materials, reducing manufacturing costs and improving chip yield. This approach has gained attention as a promising alternative to traditional SoC designs. However, increased power density and deteriorating heat dissipation conditions severely affect the functionality and stability of such systems. Thermal field inversion based on limited observations is essential to monitor the system health, but existing methods often overlook the correlation between data constraints and physical constraints, leading to insufficient prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a method based on Region-Coupled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RC-PINN) to address the thermal field inversion of chiplet packaging using small dataset. RC-PINN divides the solution domain into multiple regions based on material properties and incorporates physical constraints into the loss functions of each region to ensure the solutions comply with physical laws. Coupling between different regions is achieved through temperature and heat flux continuity conditions to maintain physical consistency. Moreover, a loss weighting strategy based on uncertainty is employed to automatically adjust the weights of loss terms, enhancing model stability and convergence. Additionally, a Gaussian Process Uncertainty-Guided Sampling (GP-UGS) method is developed for data augmentation, further improving prediction accuracy in data-sparse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RC-PINN effectively solves the thermal field inversion for chiplet packaging, achieving an average relative error of less than 0.4% under limited data conditions, with a 40% improvement in performance over traditional Neural Network methods. The GP-UGS method further improves prediction accuracy and generalization, raising the R² score to over 0.99 with only 64 observations.
