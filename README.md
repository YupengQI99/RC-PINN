# Region-Coupled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RC-PINN)
Chiplet-based packaging integrates heterogeneous chiplets with distinct functionalities as a cost-effective alternative to traditional SoCs, yet increased power density and heat dissipation challenges threaten system stability. Existing thermal inversion methods often neglect correlations between data and physical constraints, reducing prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a method based on **Region-Coupled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RC-PINN)** to address the thermal field inversion of chiplet packaging using small dataset. RC-PINN divides the solution domain into multiple regions based on material properties and incorporates physical constraints into the loss functions of each region to ensure the solutions comply with physical laws. Coupling between different regions is achieved through temperature and heat flux continuity conditions to maintain physical consistency.  Additionally, a **Gaussian Process Uncertainty-Guided Sampling (GP-UGS)** method is developed for data augmentation, further improving prediction accuracy in data-sparse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RC-PINN effectively solves the thermal field inversion for chiplet packaging, achieving an average **relative error of less than 0.4%** under limited data conditions, with a 40% improvement in performance over traditional Neural Network methods. The GP-UGS method further improves prediction accuracy and generalization, raising the RÂ² score to **over 0.99 with only 64 observations**.

# Gaussian Process Uncertainty-Guided Sampling (GP-UGS)
Although PINN models perform well with small datasets, the high cost of labeled data in real-world applications requires achieving higher accuracy with fewer data points. Data augmentation offers an effective solution. We use Gaussian Process (GP) to fit the original dataset, quantifying prediction uncertainty. Based on this uncertainty, we select optimal data points for training, expanding the dataset and improving model accuracy and robustness.
